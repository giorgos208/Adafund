The ADAFund protocol is a decentralized peer-to-peer crowdfunding service protocol that users can access to create, trade and manage digital assets on the Cardano blockchain, and perform other tasks. The Protocol is comprised of free, public, open-source or source-available software including a set of immutable and autonomous smart contracts deployed on the Cardano blockchain. Your use of the ADAFund Protocol involves various significant risks, including, but not limited to, financial loss while digital assets are being supplied to the Protocol and financial loss due to the fluctuation of prices of digital assets, collateral, or assets underlying any digital asset. Before using the ADAFund Protocol, you should closely review the relevant documentation to make sure that you understand how the Protocol works and the risks of your use of the Protocol. The Protocol may be accessed through many web or mobile computer service interfaces; you are responsible for doing your own diligence regarding such interfaces to understand the fees and risks that they present. Although ADAFund Labs, LLC developed much of the initial software code for the ADAFund Protocol, it does not provide, own, or control the ADAFund Protocol, which is run independently by smart contracts deployed on the Cardano blockchain. The Protocol does not constitute an account by which ADAFund or any other third parties act as financial intermediaries or custodians. While the software code has undergone beta testing and auditing, and continues to be improved by feedback from the community, contributors and testers, we cannot guarantee that there will be no bugs in the Protocol. Upgrades and modifications to the Protocol are likely, and will be managed in a community-driven way through decentralized governance.
